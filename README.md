# Habit Tracker

This project is a Python-based Habit Tracking Application that interacts with the Pixela API
to log and track daily running distances. It uses the requests module to send HTTP requests 
for user creation, graph creation, data entry, and updates. The program prompts users to enter
the kilometers they ran and records the data on a Pixela graph. Additionally, it includes 
functionality for modifying the logged data if needed. The application makes use of REST API
methods (POST, PUT) and ensures secure authentication using a user token.
